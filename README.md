Exploratory Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi, Iâ€™m Ajay Devkatte ðŸ‘‹
Turning raw data into meaningful stories through analysis, statistics, and machine learning
Iâ€™m currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning and Iâ€™m deeply fascinated by how fast the world is moving toward a technology-driven future.
I want to be part of that change â€” contributing to innovations that have a real impact on peopleâ€™s lives.

Iâ€™m building my skills to become a professional data & statistics scientist, someone who can not only understand data but also turn it into meaningful insights that solve real-world problems.
I love sharing my learning journey through projects like these, because knowledge is more powerful when itâ€™s shared.

About This Repository
This repository is my personal space for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects.
Here, I take raw datasets, explore them, clean them, visualize them, and uncover the stories hidden inside the numbers.
Youâ€™ll find:
â€¢	Step-by-step EDA workflows
â€¢	Clear visualizations to explain insights
â€¢	Real-world datasets from multiple domains
â€¢	Well-documented notebooks so anyone can follow along
