About This Repository
This repository is my personal collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects. Each project takes raw data and walks through the process of cleaning, preprocessing, and visualizing it to uncover meaningful patterns and actionable insights.
The goal is to strengthen my data analysis skills, understand different domains, and build a strong foundation for more advanced machine learning projects.

3.	COVID-19 Dataset EDA â€“ Understanding patterns, trends, and geographical spread.
4.	Image Classification Dataset EDA â€“ Analyzing pixel data, class distribution, and preprocessing needs before model training.
5.	Fraud Detection Dataset EDA â€“ Understanding transaction patterns, anomalies, and imbalanced data handling.
6.	Recommendation System Dataset EDA â€“ Exploring user-item interactions, sparsity, and popularity trends.
7.	Financial Market EDA â€“ Price trends, volatility analysis, and correlations in stock data.
8.	Sports Performance EDA â€“ Player stats, performance metrics, and historical patterns.
9.	Social Media Analytics EDA â€“ Sentiment patterns, trending topics, and engagement metrics.
10.	(And more datasets as I continue learning and experimenting)
